# Iris-Flower-Classification-using-K-Nearest-Neighbors-KNN-
This project demonstrates the classification of iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The model was trained and tested on the famous Iris dataset from sklearn.datasets, which contains features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The objective is to predict the species of the iris flower based on its features.

# Features:
- Data Loading: The Iris dataset was loaded from sklearn.datasets.
- Data Preprocessing:
The dataset was divided into training and test sets (80-20 split).
Target values were mapped to their respective species names.
- Data Visualization: Scatter plots were created to visualize the relationship between different features (sepal and petal dimensions) for different species.
- Model Training:
Implemented K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification with k=7.
Trained the model using the training data and evaluated its performance on the test data.
- Model Evaluation:
Calculated the accuracy score for the model.
Generated a confusion matrix to visualize prediction accuracy.

# Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn
